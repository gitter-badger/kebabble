## Food order listing powered by WordPress, integrated with Slack.

Personal project to learn more about both WordPress and Slack APIs. The actual
usage of this project is debatable, but is mostly intended as an educational
project anyway.

## Requirements
* WordPress 4+.
* Advanced Custom Fields.

## Installation
Grab a build zip, and use WordPress plugin 'add new' to add to your WordPress.

Alternatively, if you wish to compile the project yourself, you will need to
use Composer. Use `composer install` to set up the project dependencies.

Optionally, you can grab a copy of the advanced-custom-fields plugin, and
store it in the root directory of the project. Otherwise, you can instll it
seperately in your WordPress installation.
