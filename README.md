Personal project to learn more about both WordPress and Slack APIs. The actual
usage of this project is debatable, but is mostly intended as an educational
project anyway.

## Requirements
* WordPress 4+.
* Advanced Custom Fields.

## Installation
Grab a build zip, and use WordPress plugin 'add new' to add to your WordPress.

Alternatively, if you wish to compile the project yourself, you will need to
use Composer. Use `composer install` to set up the project dependencies.

Optionally, you can grab a copy of the advanced-custom-fields plugin, and
store it in the root directory of the project. Otherwise, you can instll it
seperately in your WordPress installation.
